JasperReports Library 6.20.6 Change Log
=============================================

- optional style expression added to report elements in addition to their existing static style 
reference property to allow for more flexible and dynamic styling scenarios;

- new IS_EVEN_ROW and IS_EVEN_COLUMN boolean built-in variables available in crosstabs to help 
with alternate row/column styling of crosstab cells;

- new custom configuration property net.sf.jasperreports.export.pptx.frame.as.table added to 
control the rendering of table components as true PowerPoint table structures in PPTX exports;

to limit the maximum height to which they can stretch to accommodate their larger text content 
when textAdjust attribute is set to CutText value;

size PDF files;
